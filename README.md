## **Castro's Weather App**

### Journey 
Project Setup
> * Vue
> * [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
> * PostCSS/PurgeCSS


Mobile friendly and responsive. I have tried to implement all user stories as best as possible.
The journey was very interesting for me as I had stopped using Vue and Tailwind for a while because of the company i am with now. I use Next.js and Material UI a lot now but when I saw the challenge I wanted to try it out.

It was good and purposeful for me to complete it eventhough it took a while because I have been busy.

Hope people like it. Demo website at [weather-app](https://weather-app-devchallenges.netlify.app/)
