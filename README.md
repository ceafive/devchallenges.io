Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo? -- You can see at https://image-uploader-devchallenges.netlify.app/
- What was your experience? -- I wanted to go back to using just Vanilla JS and good old CSS to do this project. I wanted to do this as simple as possible without using any frameworks and avoid any overkill.
- What have you learned/improved? -- I have really improved my use of fetch, revised how to use FormData, media queries and how to properly do DOM manipulation.
- Your wisdom? :) -- Always use plain old vanilla JS whenever it can do the work just write.
